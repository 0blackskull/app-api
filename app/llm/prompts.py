    {transits_str}

    TASK — precise step-by-step computational instructions.

    Goal: produce a fully deterministic, auditable, and verifiable "daily facts" report.  All numeric steps must be shown. Produce both a human-readable report and a machine-parsable JSON object. Do NOT output internal chain-of-thought. Instead output explicit calculation steps, formulas used, short reasoning notes, and citations where a classical rule is applied.

    PRINCIPLES:
    - Use sidereal positions (Lahiri ayanamsha) for all zodiacal calculations.
    - Timezone = IST for all timestamps and ISO format in outputs (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS IST).
    - If any required input is missing, return a structured error (see Error & Edge Cases).
    - Always include verification checks; stop and return an error object if any verification fails.
    - Short explanation/justification (1–3 lines) is allowed for each step — not internal chain-of-thought.

    DETAILED STEPS (MANDATORY — show every arithmetic step & intermediate value)

    1) Compute Panchānga (MANDATORY — show all math)
    - Inputs: sidereal longitudes (Sun_long, Moon_long) in degrees (0–360).
    - Tithi:
        - Delta = (Moon_long − Sun_long) normalized to 0–360.
        - Tithi_index = floor( Delta / 12° ) + 1  (1..30). SHOW: Delta (°), Delta/12, floor, Tithi_index.
        - If needed, compute exact start/end longitudes of that Tithi (Tithi_start_long = Sun_long + (Tithi_index−1)*12°).
    - Nakshatra & Pada:
        - Nakshatra_width = 13°20' = 13.3333333333°.
        - Nakshatra_index = floor( Moon_long / Nakshatra_width ) + 1 (1..27). SHOW: Moon_long / 13.3333 → integer + fractional → pada.
        - Pada = floor( fractional_part * 4 ) + 1 (1..4). Provide exact boundary longitudes for that Nakshatra's start/end and dla each pada.
    - Yoga:
        - Yoga_index = floor( (Sun_long + Moon_long) / Nakshatra_width ) + 1 (1..27). Show intermediate sums and division.
    - Karana:
        - Use canonical Karana sequence (list the 11 karanas and their mapping to half-tithis). Show the calculation: HalfTithiIndex = floor( Delta / 6° ) + 1 → map to Karana name (show mapping table and final Karana).
    - OUTPUT: Table with numeric columns: Tithi#, Tithi_start_long (deg), Tithi_end_long (deg), Nakshatra# & name, Pada#, Yoga#, Karana name. Show all intermediate arithmetic lines.

    2) Compute Muhūrta / Choghadiya
    - Will be calculated by the programmatic implementation, you don't need to do anything here.

    3) Derive Transit Data (MANDATORY)
    - IMPORTANT: Use the pre-calculated moon and sun transit signs provided above.
    - For Moon transit: Use the pre-calculated `current_moon_transit` value.
    - For Ascendant-lord transit: This requires additional calculations (handled separately).
    - Compute and show:
        a) Moon_sign: Use pre-calculated birth chart moon sign. For house calculations relative to natal Ascendant: house_index = 1 + ((moon_transit_sign - asc_sign + 12) % 12)). Show arithmetic.
        b) Ascendant-lord transit: determine natal ascendant lord, compute its current transit longitude, transit sign and transit house relative to natal ascendant. Show steps.
        c) Current Vimshottari chain (Maha → Antara → Pratyantara) for the relevant window: show full start/end dates for each segment using canonical Vimshottari proportions (cite the formula). Present in compact table.

    4) Determine Lucky Color (MANDATORY, show arithmetic + mapping)
    A) Lucky Color (RULES):
        - Must be exactly two words, lowercase, separated by a single space (e.g., "space violet").
        - Algorithm:
        1. Identify primary rulership: Moon Nakshatra lord (primary), Ascendant-lord (secondary), day-lord (weekday) and primary benefic (contextual).
        2. Map each planet to a classical color (provide cited mapping table). Choose adjective from primary ruling planet mapping; noun from secondary—explain choice in ≤40 words.
        3. Output chosen two-word color and show the mapping table lines used.
        4. Provide a hex color code (e.g., "#FF6B35") that represents the chosen color.
        - If ambiguity arises, choose the best-fit two-word color and explain which planets contributed adjective and noun (≤20 words).
    B) Lucky Number:
        - Will be calculated by the programmatic implementation, you don't need to do anything here.

    5) Identify All Auspicious / Inauspicious Periods
    - Will be calculated by the programmatic implementation, you don't need to do anything here.

    6) Evaluate Ratings (1–5) and Remedies
    - Derive `day_rating` (1–5) and five `life_aspects` (financial, physical_health, mental_health, relationship, career).  
    - For each aspect, explicitly compute **stepwise numeric derivation** using an additive model:  
        - natal_base (derived from natal chart positions, strength of significators)  
        - transit_influences (benefic/malefic aspects, conjunctions, dignities)  
        - panchānga_factors (Tithi, Nakshatra, Yoga of the day)  
        - other modifiers if applicable (retrogrades, combustion, eclipses).  

    Example:  
    financial_score = natal_base(3.0) + transit_Jupiter(+0.5) − malefic_aspect(−0.3) + favorable_tithi(+0.2) = 3.4 → round = 3  
    round off to nearest integer.

    - Always **show the arithmetic with labeled weights**, then round to nearest integer for the rating.  

    - **If any aspect ≤ 4:**  
    - Give 2–3 possible events/situations (20–40 words) consistent with the rating.
    - Possible events must be based on natal base, transit influences, panchānga factors and other modifiers.
    - Suggest 2–3 **non-astrological, practical remedies** (40–60 words).  

    - **If any aspect = 5:**  
    - Provide a short, positive reasoning (30–40 words) explaining why that aspect is strong, with **minimal astrology jargon**.  

    - Each aspect output must include:  
    - `score_calculation` (formula with weights)  
    - `rating` (integer 1–5)  
    - `remedy_or_reasoning` (depending on rating)  
    - `confidence` % = (# of independent signals aligned ÷ total considered) × 100  

    - Ensure **textual explanation always matches numeric rating** (no mismatch like score=3 with “very good”). 

    7) Compile Current Signs (explicit)
    - IMPORTANT: Use the pre-calculated signs provided above. Do NOT recalculate them.
    - Output the exact values:
        - `moon_sign`: {pre_calc_signs.get('moon_sign', 'Calculate if not provided')}
        - `sun_sign`: {pre_calc_signs.get('sun_sign', 'Calculate if not provided')}
        - `zodiac_sign`: Same as sun_sign
        - If signs were not pre-calculated, show your calculation steps.

    8) Do’s and Don’ts (symbolic, constrained)
    - Produce exactly 3 Do’s and 3 Don’ts. Each must be < 4 words, symbolic (no clichés) e.g.:
        - Statement: `airplane mode`
        - Logic: if Mercury retrograde → avoid new contracts
    - If a symbolic item cannot be produced without being a cliché, explain why (≤2 lines) and give a best-effort set.
    {genz_dos_donts_note}

    9) Mystical Counsel
    - ONE poetic line < 10 words, grounded in a specific transit. E.g., `"Tend the ember, not the blaze."`.
    - No astrological details in the poetic line. Just a poetic line based on the transit.
    - It should be set in the mystical_counsel field.
    {genz_mystical_note}

    10) Advice for the day
    - Provide a detailed advice for the day based on the day ratings, life aspects, dos, donts and most importantly mystical counsel.
    - It should be detailed, atleast 50 words.
    - It should be in plain text format.
    {genz_advice_note}


    11) Verification & Final Check (MANDATORY — produce results only if pass)
        - Checks to run (show arithmetic & boolean results):
        a. Panchānga arithmetic (Tithi/Nakshatra/Yoga/Karana) must be internally consistent (e.g., Delta degrees yield the printed Tithi index).
        b. Vimshottari dasha chain dates consistent with canonical proportions (cite formula).
        c. Lucky number reduction steps must match stepwise sums shown.
        d. Note: Choghadiya time segment calculations are verified separately by the programmatic implementation.

    12) Style & Constraints
        - Human report tone: mystical, symbolic, deterministic, concise.
        - NEVER output internal chain-of-thought. Only structured arithmetic steps, tables, short reasoning notes (rules, formulas, citations).
        - For every numeric line use explicit expressions (e.g., `Day_length = 06:12:36 = 372.6 minutes = 22356 seconds`).
        - Two-word color: lower-case, single space, both words alphabetical characters only.
        - All times in ISO IST.
        - End the human-readable report with a single-line summary sentence (high/medium/low chance phrasing) about the day’s overall auspiciousness.

    Verification & finalization:
    - Run every check in (10). If all pass, emit human-readable AND JSON outputs.
    - If any check fails, emit the structured error object and do not produce a final report.

    Appendices:
    - Where a classical mapping/table is used (Rahu Kāla slots, Karana listing, Vimshottari proportions), include a short citation line with the source name (e.g., "Bṛhat Parāśara Hora Śāstra" or "BPHS (classical table)"); if multiple sources exist mention primary and alternates.
    - Note: Choghadiya sequences and calculations are handled programmatically using classical Vedic timing rules.
